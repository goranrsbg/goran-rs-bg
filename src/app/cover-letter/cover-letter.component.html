  <span>In the next few paragraphs I will briefly describe my introduction to programming.</span>
  <p>I wrote my first programming lines in High school, where I was for the first time introduced to the basics of programming (Basic, Pascal, and C). During that time, I also learned the basics of Assembler, and the way in which the CPU and memory store, process, and manage data. Since I understood the logic of programming very well, and was no stranger to Maths as well, I became student of the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade (IT Department). Regrettably, I left the Faculty without a degree due to personal reasons. Nevertheless, this temporary failure did not sway my desire to do programming.</p>
  <p>Wishing to expand my programming knowledge beyond the C language, I successfully completed a single-year course at the IT Academy in Belgrade, which earned me a "Software Developer" certificate. During my studies at the Academy, I was introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS, Java, PHP, and MySQL. After the studies I devoted myself to Java, because I had considered this programming language as the perfect opportunity to upgrade my existing knowledge of C. This upgrading process included an extensive reading and usage of the <i>Java Programming Language</i> book, by Laslo Kraus. Another book which contributed to my programming knowledge was <i>Core Java 2 Volume II - Advanced Features</i>, by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell. These books taught me the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP), basics of threads as well as collections. During the past two years I have spent much time testing my Java programming skills by solving various puzzles on the CodingGame platform (profile nickname: goranRSbg). Among other, CodingGame introduced me to Dijkstra's algorithm and trie. In the past few months I have created a minor project in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), which automatizes certain processes in MS Word and Excell. In addition, I have established this website with a JavaEE backend and simple MySQL database.</p>
  <p>Even though I acquired my entire programming knowledge and skills without professional guidance, I have a sound basis for any programming challenge, and a great willigness to learn more.</p>
